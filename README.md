# Japanese-Study-Tool
wxWidgets port of my Japanese study tool

IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not a c++ developer. This is intended to be a functional app that I hope 
more than just I will use, as well as one which others can add onto as they see fit, but it is 
my first real project in c++, so do not expect any good code at all.
